# Cousins Program

This short Java program stores groups of cousins in a 2D array and prints each row using a nested loop. Each inner array represents one family, and the program prints all the children on the same line.

## How It Works

- A `String[][]` array is used to hold the cousin groups.
- A nested loop prints each row of names.
- A for-each loop is used for cleaner and more readable iteration.

## Expected Output
```
Cousins:

Maddy Ross Henry
Brian Kevin Kristin
Ellie Hanna Jack Ben
```

## Purpose
This activity was part of a practice exercise to get comfortable with two-dimensional arrays in Java and looping through rows and columns.
A portion of the code was provided, I wrote the loops.
