## Overview

This assignment focused on learning the basics of Object-Oriented Programming by creating a simple `Person` class and a separate driver class called `PersonDemo`.  
The goal was to understand how classes, objects, methods, and variables work together in Java.

I created:
- **Person** – stores a person’s name, age, and email, and includes methods to display info, calculate birth year, and check if they’re an adult  
- **PersonDemo** – creates two `Person` objects and calls the methods to show how everything connects

## What I Learned

- How to define a class and use a constructor to set up object data  
- The difference between **instance variables** and **local variables**  
- How to return values from methods and use them in another class  
- How booleans can check conditions like age

## Notes

I tried accessing a local variable from outside its method and confirmed that it’s not possible since local variables only exist while that method runs.  
This helped me understand scope and why data should be passed or returned when needed.
