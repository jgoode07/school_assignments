# Car Program – Aggregation and Composition

This program was built for **Module 1, Assignment 2**, to show how inheritance works using a simple car example.  
It includes a main `Car` superclass and two subclasses, `NewCar` and `UsedCar`, each with their own variables and constructors.

## Files
- **Car.java** – Base class that stores a car’s price and includes a constructor and accessor method.  
- **NewCar.java** – Subclass that adds a `color` variable, plus `equals()` and `display()` methods.  
- **UsedCar.java** – Subclass that adds a `mileage` variable, plus `equals()` and `display()` methods.  
- **CarDriver.java** – Main program that tests the classes and prints results if cars are equal.

## Output Example
```
Price = $16000.66, Colour = silver
Price = $5000.00, Mileage = 100,000
